# goto

gt is a simple and user-friendly way to jump to your indexed directories.

gt is short for "goto", which is basically what you want to do with minimal
keystrokes.

## Features

* Convenient syntax `gt XXX` to jump to XXX's path
* Easy indexing of all directories by using 


## Installation 

Paste `eval $(goto init)` in your bashrc or zshrc.

The binary's name is `goto` while the command you should be using is `gt`.
A shell-based workaround inspired by https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide and
https://github.com/gsamokovarov/jump is used as it is not possible to change the
working directory of your shell programmatically.

## Command-Line Options

```
‚ùØ gt help
gt

USAGE:
    goto [name]... [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

ARGS:
    <name>...    Refers to name of index. Must be specific for now

SUBCOMMANDS:
    add      Add directories and sub-directories to index
    help     Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    init     Initialises bash-script and database.

## Tutorial

#### Indexing a directory

```
gt add
gt add -r n
```

#### List indexed directories
If you wish to list and inspect your current indexed directories. 
```
gt ls
```

#### Jumping to an indexed directory
Use `gt <PATH>` to jump to your desired folder. The `<PATH>` is the folder name.
For example to jump to `Users/xxx/project/personal`, the command `gt personal`
will change your shell directory to the desired path.

#### Cleaning up index to ensure all paths are valid
Use `gt prune` to update and remove non-existent directories.
